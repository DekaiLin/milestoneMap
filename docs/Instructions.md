# Overview
## What was the problem we were trying to solve?
For a Programme Manager working in the IT delivery space what we want to monitor (and communicate consitently) at the high level is:
1. What the projects and programmes are delivering and when (Milestones)?
2. How confident are we that we will meet that delivery (Health)?
3. Is the delivery reliant on anything else (Dependency)?
4. What has changed (Compare)?

What we don't want to do is constantly have to draw up slides to reflect this to our stakeholders.

milestoneMap was developed to capture and report on this information and do comparisons between the status at 2 different dates.
