# Overview
## What problem are we were trying to solve?
For a Programme Manager working in the IT delivery space what we want to monitor (and communicate consitently) at the high level is:
1. What the projects and programmes are delivering and when (Milestones)?
2. How confident are we that we will meet that delivery (Health)?
3. Is the delivery reliant on anything else (Dependency)?
4. What has changed (Compare)?

What we don't want to do is constantly have to draw up slides to reflect this to our stakeholders.

milestoneMap was developed to capture and report on this information and do comparisons between the status at 2 different dates.

# User Guide
## Set Up
milestoneMap can be installed locally or run from GitHub (recommended).

To run from GitHub use the following URL [https://andymac-2.github.io/milestoneMap/](https://andymac-2.github.io/milestoneMap/)

## Basics
### Creating a milestoneMap
Creating a milestone Map is as simple as saving the file. 

![Open milestonMap and then 2 steps ...](./helpfiles/SetUP_1.png)

1. Change the title by selecting the "New Map" text at the top of the page. This will be the name of the .JSON file that is created when you select the "Save" option.

![... change the title ...](./helpfiles/Setup_2.png)

2. Select "Save".

![...and select save.](./helpfiles/Setup_3.png)

*Note! Depending on your browser settings you may have different ways presented to you to save the JSON file. Consider if you want to save copies as you progress or maintain a single file that you overwrite each time.*

	e.g. Chrome has settings to prompt for the overwriting or not.
